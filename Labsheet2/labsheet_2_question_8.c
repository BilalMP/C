/*
Given the length of two sides of a triangle and the size of the angle between the
two sides, the length of the third side can be calculated from the Cos Rule: a2=b2 +
c2 â€“ 2bc Cos A. Other angles can also be calculated from the sine rule, which is
a
sine A
= b
sine B
= c
sineC. Furthermore, the area is calculated as 12
ab sineC .
Write a program that allows the input of two sides of a triangle and the angle
between the two sides and it displays the length of the 3rd side, the remaining
angles as well as the area of the triangle.
